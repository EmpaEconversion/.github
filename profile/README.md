### Mission of Our Lab

Our lab focuses on advancing sustainable energy technologies by innovating materials and devices for energy conversion and storage. We specialize in developing functional materials, characterizing their properties, and optimizing their performance in real-world applications.

This repository hosts software tools for automating cycling data acquisition and analysis. By centralizing these tools, we aim to enhance research efficiency, foster collaboration, and drive progress in sustainable energy technology development.
