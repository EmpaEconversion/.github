### Mission of our lab

Our lab strives to solve industry-relevant challenges to enable sustainable energy conversion and storage. By combining materials science and technological innovation we advance batteries and renewable fuels for mobility and stationary storage. Our laboratory possesses strong competences in the processing and characterization of materials for batteries and electrocatalysis, and their integration into electrochemical cells. Our research focuses on understanding the interplay between materials chemistry, structure, as well as transport and interfacial phenomena through experiments and data-driven approaches. Our laboratory is also affiliated with ETH Zurich, Departement of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering and EPFL, School of Engineering, Institute of Materials.

This repository hosts software tools for automating cycling data acquisition and analysis. By centralizing these tools, we aim to enhance research efficiency, foster collaboration, and drive progress in sustainable energy technology development.

**Prof. Dr. Corsin Battaglia**  

Corsin Battaglia is directing the laboratory Materials for Energy Conversion at Empa, the Swiss Federal Laboratories of Materials Science and Technology, and is Adjunct Professor of Electrical Engineering at ETH Zurich, Department of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering and Adjunct Professor of Materials Science at EPFL, School of Engineering, Institute of Materials. His current research focuses on sustainable next-generation lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries, post-lithium-ion batteries, and the electrochemical conversion of CO₂ to synthetic fuels.  

After receiving his PhD in Physics from the Université de Neuchâtel, he was a postdoctoral researcher at EPFL, the University of California Berkeley, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories, before joining Empa in 2014. He is co-author of ~200 peer-reviewed scientific publications and 8 patent applications. He is currently the president of the Swiss Battery Association iBAT, member of the Alistore European Research Institute, Swiss representative in the long-term large-scale European battery initiative Battery2030, scientific committee member of the Upcell Alliance, and founding member of the Battery European Partnership Association.
